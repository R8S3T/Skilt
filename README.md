# Skilt

Skilt is an in-development mobile application tailored for apprentices in the SHK trade. Built with React Native and Expo, the app aims to simplify and enhance the learning experience, especially for those whose first language isn't German.

## Current State

The project is currently in the development phase. Features, functionalities, and documentation may undergo significant changes.

## Setup (Basic)

1. Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.
2. Expo CLI: While you can use npx to run Expo commands without a global installation, frequent users may prefer installing the CLI globally:
`npm install -g expo-cli`
3. Clone the repository and navigate to its directory.
4. Run `npx expo start`.
